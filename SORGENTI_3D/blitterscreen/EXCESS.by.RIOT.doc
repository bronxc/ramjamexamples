Excess/RIOT (SIH95 40k intro)

If your A1200 got fastmem then enjoy the 3 fx at 50Hz.
The fx are that kind of bitmap fx you normally need a chunky-mode for.
Or an Amiga.

Added to this archive to show how gfx look like on the blitterscreen
(BTW the intro uses different blitter-conversion, and the logo flipper
is EOR-filling)
