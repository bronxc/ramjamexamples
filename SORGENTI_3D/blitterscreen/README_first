** Blitterscreen package.

use prec2 to get sources in normal format.
bs2x2.s/bs2x1.s (called bs.s in docu) is example usage of the routines
in bltscr.s

read bltscr.doc for source explanations.

all assembled with prec2 & a68k, link bs.o and bltscr.o together.
  I hope XREF & XDEF work with your assembler. XDEF exports labels/EQUs,
  XREF imports them.

view EXCESS to see what the 2x2 mode looks like (hardwarehack, problems
with 040 boards).
