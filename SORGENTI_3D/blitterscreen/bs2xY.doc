bs2xY.s is example source to show usage of routines in bltscr.s
To get sources in normal format use prec2.

running bs2xY you will see someting boring, cpu storing continuous colors
chunky-bytewise. Only interesting for coders (and for THEM not boring
at all ;)
For having an impression what the 2x2 mode looks like when treated
with bitmap gfx, look at our intro EXCESS (note: it's same screenmode
but does different blitteraction. if your A1200 got fastmem it does
2x2 fullscreen rotzooming in 50Hz, 256 colors of course :)
